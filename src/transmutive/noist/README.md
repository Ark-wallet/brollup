# Non-Interactive Single-rounnd Threshold Signatures.
`NOIST` is a non-interactive, single-round t-of-n threshold signing scheme; allowing multiple untrusted entities to come together and jointly produce signatures in constant time, where a disruptive signer cannot force a re-do of the entire round. The resulting signature is a single 64-byte BIP-340 compatible Schnorr signature.
